#CSED211:Introduction to Computer Software Systems

This course provides fundamental concepts about how modern computer systems operate from a programmer's perspective, such as how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. The course aims to enable students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability, and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for other systems courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. The topics covered include machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.
