This course provides fundamental concepts about how modern computer systems operate from a programmer's perspective, such as how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. The topics covered include machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory hierarchy and cache, control flow(exceptions, signals), virtual memory, and dynamic memory allocation.


## 1_data lab
The data lab aims to implement simple bitwise operations, including: bitNor, isZero, addOK, absVal, and logicalShift.

## 2_data lab-floating point
The data lab-floating point aims to implement integer, floating point operations, including: negate, isLess, float_abs, float_twice, float_i2f, float_f2i.

## 3_bomb lab
The bomb lab aims to pass 6 phases without causing the bomb to explode by analyzing assembly code with GDB and providing the appropriate input for each phase.

## 4_attack lab
The attack lab aims to solve 3 code injection attack problems and 2 return-oriented programming problems by finding an attack input string for each problem.

## 5_cache lab
The cache lab consists of two parts: implementing a cache memory simulator and implementing a matrix transpose function with minimal cache misses.

## 6_shell lab
The shell lab aims to implement a simple shell (tsh) that supports the following functionalities: running commands, launching foreground jobs, launching background jobs, and switching between foreground and background jobs.

## 7_malloc lab
The malloc lab aims to implement a dynamic storage allocator in C program using malloc, realloc, free, and initialization routines.
